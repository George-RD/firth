# Getting started with Firth

This guide describes the **implemented portable execution profile**, rather
than every feature in the language design. It is also the starting point for
an agent authoring and running a program.

## Installation

The current distribution is the source repository. There is no standalone
release installer. Install Git, Python 3.11 or newer, a C toolchain, and the
[elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan#installation) and
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/) toolchain managers. Ubuntu needs a working C
compiler and linker; on macOS install the Xcode command-line tools.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/George-RD/firth.git
cd firth
```

The checked-in pins select Lean `leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0` and Rust `1.93.0`.
Do not substitute an arbitrary Lean version: proof-module identities are
verified against the pinned build. Rust's pin includes rustfmt and clippy.

```sh
python3 --version
lake --version
cargo --version
lake build
(cd src/runtime/vm && cargo build --locked)
```

Run commands from the repository root. The runner rebuilds its three Lean
adapters and the Rust executable incrementally before use. Build messages do
not contaminate its JSON output. No external SMT solver is needed for the
pure examples below. The CI workflow tests the source build on Ubuntu 24.04;
other environments must pass the same gates before their results are trusted.

## First program

Create `add.firth`:

```firth
: main
  ( -- result:Int^many )
  41 1 prim +;
```

A colon begins a word definition and a semicolon ends it. The parentheses
state its stack effect: this word consumes nothing and returns one integer.
The body runs left to right. `41` and `1` push values; `prim +` consumes both
and pushes their sum. `^many` means a value can be copied or discarded.

```sh
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py check add.firth
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py run add.firth --entry main
```

The run result is a JSON object containing:

```json
{"status":"success","command":"run","entry":"main","stack":[42]}
```

The actual object also includes `words`, `fuel`, `kernel_cost` and `vm_cost`.
The example above shows the result fields to inspect, not the entire output.
`check` validates definitions but does not establish that every feature has a
portable compiler implementation. `run` also compiles and executes.

## Inputs, multiple words and branches

`examples/mvp/choose-increment.firth` contains:

```firth
: main
  (forall ρ; ρ n:Int^many flag:Bool^many -- ρ result:Int^many)
  [ increment ] [ identity ] if;

: increment
  (forall ρ; ρ n:Int^many -- ρ result:Int^many)
  1 prim +;

: identity
  (forall ρ; ρ n:Int^many -- ρ result:Int^many)
  ;
```

`ρ` is the untouched part of the stack. `forall ρ` binds it. The rightmost
input is the top of the stack. Names such as `n` and `result` only document
the stack: they are not variables, and writing `n` in the body is an
unresolved name. The body works on the stack itself. To refer to inputs by
name, bind them with `locals`, which takes one value off the stack for each
name, the last name from the top:

```firth
: difference
  (forall ρ; ρ a:Int^many b:Int^many -- ρ r:Int^many)
  locals { a b } { a b prim - };
```

Inside the second braces, `a` and `b` can be used any number of times. The
result is whatever the block leaves on the stack; `r` is never assigned.
The names follow the stack effect from left to right, so the top input is the
last name. A block that opens the body and uses the stack effect's names in
another order, such as `locals { b a }` here, is refused with
`firth.name.locals-order`: it would give `b` the value the effect calls `a`.

Brackets create a quotation: code that runs only when called or selected.
`if` consumes the Boolean below the two quotations and executes the first
quotation for `true`, or the second for `false`.

```sh
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py check examples/mvp/choose-increment.firth
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py run examples/mvp/choose-increment.firth \
  --entry main --stack '[41, true]'
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py run examples/mvp/choose-increment.firth \
  --entry main --stack '[41, false]'
```

These runs return stacks `[42]` and `[41]`. JSON stack values are written
bottom to top. Booleans must be JSON `true` and `false`, not strings. The
runner checks the supplied values against the selected word's declared input
types before executing.

The entry is explicit. It can precede a helper, follow it, or itself be a
helper. A final unused definition does not become the entry by accident.
The checked dictionary, including the entry itself, is passed to the
reference interpreter so ordinary calls and recursion resolve consistently.

```sh
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py run examples/mvp/choose-increment.firth \
  --entry increment --stack '[9]'
```

That returns `[10]`. A qualified entry uses its full source name, such as
`arithmetic.increment`, not the compiler's mangled target identifier.

## More executable examples

| File | Entry and input stack | Expected output stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/mvp/double.firth` | `main`, `[21]` | `[42]` |
| `examples/mvp/double.firth` | `main`, `[true, 21]` | `[true, 42]` |
| `examples/mvp/qualified-call.firth` | `main`, `[41]` | `[42]` |
| `examples/mvp/locals-add.firth` | `main`, `[20, 22]` | `[42]` |
| `examples/mvp/quoted-value.firth` | `main`, `[]` | `[42]` |

The doubling example uses `dup prim +`. The qualified-call example defines
a word inside `vocab arithmetic { ... }`. The locals example uses
`locals { a b } { a b prim + }`, which elaborates to stack operations rather
than a runtime environment. See the frozen
[agent language guide](firth-agent-guide.md) for the wider grammar and
ownership model; the support table below takes precedence for this runner.

## Saved regression tests

The same public runner can check saved input/output cases against both the VM
and reference interpreter:

```sh
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py test examples/mvp/choose-increment.tests.json
```

A suite uses the following format. `source` is relative to the suite file,
not the current working directory. Every case names its entry explicitly.

```json
{
  "schema": "firth.tests.v1",
  "source": "choose-increment.firth",
  "cases": [
    {"name": "increment when true", "entry": "main", "stack": [41, true], "expected_stack": [42]},
    {"name": "keep value when false", "entry": "main", "stack": [41, false], "expected_stack": [41]},
    {"name": "call helper directly", "entry": "increment", "stack": [9], "expected_stack": [10]}
  ]
}
```

A suite must have 1 to 128 cases with unique non-empty names, fit within
1,048,576 UTF-8 bytes, and use at most 256 values per input or expected stack.
Both stacks use the portable integers, Booleans and sequences listed below;
`true` never matches `1`. Unknown or duplicate JSON fields, invalid values and empty suites
are rejected before a build. Absolute source paths are not accepted. Relative
paths such as `../src/component.firth` are supported.

The toolchain builds once per suite. Each case then checks and compiles the
source in a separate scratch workspace, compares both hosts, and checks the
expected stack. A failure does not skip later cases. `--fuel` has the same
bounds as `run` and applies separately to every case. Exhaustion is a failure,
not a passing test. Version 1 does not support expected-error cases or skips.

A completed suite prints one `firth.test-results.v1` JSON report to stdout with
`status`, `passed`, `failed` and ordered `cases`. Its exit code is `0` only when
all cases pass, otherwise `1`. Invalid input or a setup/build failure instead
prints a JSON error to stderr and exits `1`; command usage errors exit `2`.
Each completed execution retains its `trace_comparison` label. A matching
expected stack does not upgrade unsupported quotation-trace comparison to
agreement, prove a source contract or establish compiler correctness.

## Errors and finite execution

Normal successful output is one JSON object on stdout with exit status `0`.
A source, input, compilation, execution or comparison failure produces a JSON
error on stderr and exit status `1`. Argument usage errors use argparse's
message and exit status `2`. Do not interpret a missing result as success.

```sh
# Wrong input type: this must fail, not coerce true to 1.
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py run examples/mvp/double.firth \
  --entry main --stack '[true]'

# Unknown entry: this must fail, not fall back to another word.
python3 tools/loop/firth_run.py run examples/mvp/double.firth \
  --entry missing --stack '[21]'
```

The default fuel budget is 100,000 steps, and `--fuel` accepts an integer from
0 to 1,000,000 (the largest budget the VM adapter accepts). Each host records
only the first 4096 trace events; later steps still run and are charged, the
final stack and kernel cost are compared in full, and the trace comparison is
then reported as `agreed-prefix` rather than `agreed`. Recursive
definitions are permitted, but exhausting the bound does not prove divergence
and is never accepted as a successful run. A call in last position (a word
call, `call` or `if` as the final instruction of a word or quotation body) is a
tail call: it reuses the current frame, so loops written as tail recursion run
until fuel rather than hitting a depth limit. Non-tail recursion deeper than
256 administrative frames traps with `resource-fault` on the VM alone, which is
reported as a mismatch rather than agreement. Quotations that own linear
captures keep their own frame. See `examples/programs/` for loops, factorial,
Fibonacci and an allocator that run on both hosts. The VM and
reference interpreter report cost differently: VM word entry and capture
restoration carry administrative target charges, so reference cost is compared
with `kernel_cost`, not the larger `vm_cost`. Capture restoration still consumes
VM fuel; a zero kernel charge does not make a VM instruction free to execute.

Integers are signed: `-3` is a literal and `3 5 prim -` is `-2`. `prim +`,
`prim -` and `prim *` must stay within the signed 64-bit range
(`-9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807`) for portable execution; overflow
fails instead of wrapping. `prim <`, `prim <=`, `prim >`, `prim >=` and
`prim =` take two integers and push a Boolean for `if`: `a b prim <=` is
whether `a` is at most `b`, so `3 3 prim <=` is `true` and `3 3 prim <` is
`false`. `prim and`, `prim or` and `prim not` combine Booleans.
`prim div` and `prim mod` are Euclidean: `a b prim div` is the quotient `q`
and `a b prim mod` the remainder `r` with `a = b*q + r` and `0 <= r < |b|`, so
`-7 2 prim div` is `-4` and `-7 2 prim mod` is `1`. A zero divisor traps with
`primitive-fault` on both hosts, and `-9223372036854775808 -1 prim div`
overflows on the VM like `prim *`. The reference interpreter's integers are unbounded; the
finite VM's refusal is not evidence of agreement.

The comparison gate validates every returned scalar before comparing stacks.
It rejects malformed values, Boolean/integer payload coercions, and unsupported
quotation results. Quotations may still be created and consumed inside a
program, as in the conditional example above. This is not full quotation or
execution-trace equivalence.

## Supported execution profile

| Feature | Current portable runner |
| --- | --- |
| External inputs and final results | Signed 64-bit integers, Booleans, and sequences of either as JSON arrays (`[1, 2]` is a `Seq Int`, `[true]` a `Seq Bool`; `[]` takes its type from the word's signature) |
| Source type name for integers | `Int`, signed; literals may be negative (`-3`) |
| Primitive operations | `prim +`, `prim -`, `prim *`, `prim div`, `prim mod` : `Int Int -- Int` (`div` and `mod` trap on a zero divisor); `prim <`, `prim <=`, `prim >`, `prim >=`, `prim =` : `Int Int -- Bool`; `prim and`, `prim or` : `Bool Bool -- Bool`; `prim not` : `Bool -- Bool`; `prim seq-int.empty`, `.len`, `.at`, `.push`, `.set` and the same for `seq-bool` (see `examples/programs/README.md`) |
| Sequences | `Seq Int` and `Seq Bool`, written `{ 1 2 3 }` or `{ true false }`; a negative or out-of-range `at` or `set` index traps with `primitive-fault` on both hosts |
| Definitions | Explicit stack effects, multiple words, qualified vocabulary names, recursion with finite fuel |
| Composition | Core stack operations, quotations, `call`, `if`, named locals (a block takes its values off the stack; a local may be used any number of times, inside `if` branches, inside quotations and inside nested blocks. A local can't be used after running a quotation whose stack effect is unknown there, such as one passed in as a value; that is refused with `firth.elaboration.untracked-local`); matching checked effects are required |
| Quotations as external inputs/results | Explicitly rejected; returned bodies and captures do not yet have a shared comparison format |
| Text and character execution | Not implemented by the portable compiler/adapters |
| `send`, file/network I/O, external resources | Not implemented by this portable execution path |
| Source refinement annotations `{...}` | Rejected with `firth.refinement.unsupported-source` until source predicates and bodies are translated and checked, even when the annotation happens to be true |
| Linear effects and pushed linear quotation values | Not supported by the portable compiler; unsupported ownership is rejected rather than erased |
| Core vocabulary | `stdlib/core.firth` contains identity, duplication, discard and exchange examples; it is not automatically imported |
| General-purpose standard library, package manager, editor language server | Future work |

In particular, the `send-once` example in the frozen agent guide describes the
intended linear-effect surface, not an executable network operation available
through `firth_run.py`. An unsupported primitive must be rejected by compilation.

## Source guarantees are not inferred from syntax

A word containing a refinement annotation is currently refused before erasure.
For example, `: main ( -- n:Int^many{n > 0} ) 0 ;` must not receive checked
artefacts. Returning `1` instead does not make source refinement checking
implemented: that annotated word is refused too. Write a plain typed word for
typed-only execution; do not remove a required contract merely to get a pass.
Empty source, including a vocabulary with no words, is a structured
`firth.elaboration.empty-program` failure.

The solver's internal unit/integration facilities do not establish that a
predicate written in source was translated or discharged. See the
[roadmap](roadmap.md) for the separate source-refinement implementation task.

## What a successful run establishes

The runner checks source, compiles the checked representation, and compares
successful terminal status, final stack and kernel-comparable cost with the
Lean reference interpreter. It bounds each execution and compares the two
traces event by event after projecting both onto kernel-charged steps: the
projected lengths and per-step charges must match, and when no intermediate
stack holds a quotation every stack must be equal (`trace_comparison:
agreed`). A program whose intermediate stacks hold quotations is labelled
`unsupported-quotation-values` instead, which is neither a failure nor a
claim of agreement. It does **not** compare residual programs or frames
across hosts, establish arbitrary effect agreement, a universal
compiler-correctness theorem or the business intent of the application.
Non-pure world observations are refused.

The low-level JSON adapters are internal pipeline boundaries. A string such
as `"checking_state":"checked"` is not an externally authenticated proof.
Use the source runner rather than constructing purported checked records by
hand. A successful `check` is not a security sandbox for untrusted host code.

For an agent, the working loop is: declare the stack effect, write a small
word, run `check`, run an explicit entry with representative inputs, and
inspect both the exit status and JSON. Preserve failing cases as tests. Never
replace an expected output just because the implementation produced another.

## Reproduce the checks

```sh
lake build
lake test
(cd src/runtime/vm && cargo fmt --check && \
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --locked)
python3 tools/loop/test_mvp_agent_gate.py
python3 tools/loop/mvp_agent_gate.py
python3 tools/loop/check_language_examples.py
```

`check_language_examples.py` exercises the examples, both conditional paths,
word ordering, row preservation, external input failures, a type error, fuel
exhaustion and overflow. It also invokes the documented check/run/test commands
and runs saved suites covering expected results, typed mismatches and failure
continuation.
These fixtures test implementation behaviour; they are not presented as a
fresh independent-agent benchmark. The original four authored examples keep
their separate source and transcript provenance in the MVP manifest.

## Troubleshooting

**`lake` or `cargo` not found:** install elan/rustup, then ensure their binary
directories are on PATH in the shell running Python. Build from the repository
root so the checked-in toolchain pins apply.

**Proof-module hash unavailable or mismatched:** check the Lean pin and use a
clean build. Do not skip the check or regenerate the committed manifest merely
to get a passing result. An intentional change to governed proof modules needs
a reviewed rebuild and updated bindings under the repository's development
procedure.

**A word checks but does not compile:** compare its primitives and value types
with the portable support table. Parsing or checking a wider design feature
does not imply the VM adapter implements it.

**Fuel exhausted or VM/reference mismatch:** retain the source, inputs, entry,
fuel and diagnostic. Treat the run as failed. Do not weaken comparison to make
the example pass.

## Compiler trust boundary

See [compiler admission](compiler-admission.md) for source binding, direct
kernel checking and the distinction between content hashes and proof.
