# S7 authoring experiment

The PRD's goal S7 exists to test Firth's core bet: that explicit stack
signatures make a language models can write well. This directory is a cheap,
repeatable measurement of that bet. A model that has only read the language
docs solves small tasks in Firth and in Python, and hidden tests score both.

## How it works

- `tasks.py` holds 22 tasks. Each has a description, its input and output
  shape, one visible example, 2 to 6 hidden test inputs and a Python reference
  that computes the expected stack. Values are non-negative integers and
  Booleans, the only values the portable runner can pass in or read back.
  Each task records the capabilities it `needs`. Eleven need only `prim +`,
  stack words, quotations and `if`; the other eleven need subtraction,
  comparison, multiplication or loops, which the runner does not have yet.
- `harness.py prompt` builds the author prompt. For Firth it contains
  `docs/getting-started.md` and `docs/firth-agent-guide.md` verbatim, then the
  tasks. Nothing from `src/`, `tools/` or `examples/` is included, so the
  prompt follows whatever the docs say at the time of the run.
- `harness.py score` runs every answer against the visible example and the
  hidden tests. Firth goes through `tools/loop/firth_run.py run`, so a pass
  also means the VM and the Lean reference interpreter agreed. A task passes
  only when every hidden test returns exactly the expected stack, with no
  Boolean/integer coercion.
- `harness.py repair` builds a second-round prompt showing each failing
  answer's result on the visible example only. Hidden tests are never shown.
- `classify.py` labels why each failed task failed. Tasks that need a
  capability the runner lacks are labelled `missing_primitive` by rule. The
  rest are sent to TypeSafe's Jev classifier (`jev-1.13.0`), which is cheap and
  fast but can only pick from fixed labels. Pass/fail never comes from Jev.
- `reference/firth-today.json` has hand-written Firth solutions for the eleven
  runnable tasks. They pass 11/11 and check the harness itself.

```sh
python3 eval/s7/harness.py prompt --lang firth > prompt.md
# give prompt.md to the author model; save its reply as answer.md
python3 eval/s7/harness.py extract answer.md > solutions.json
python3 eval/s7/harness.py score --lang firth solutions.json --label "firth sonnet" > results.json
python3 eval/s7/harness.py report results.json
python3 eval/s7/classify.py solutions.json results.json --available add > modes.json
```

The author model is run separately, as a sub-agent told to read only the
prompt file and to use no other tool. The transcripts were checked afterwards:
each author read the prompt file and wrote its answer, and did nothing else.
This is an instruction plus an audit, not a sandbox.

## Run 1: 27 September 2026, `prim +` only

Main at `c6b1a19`. Authors: Claude Sonnet 5 and Claude Haiku 4.5, one answer
per task, all 22 tasks in one prompt. Results and answers are in
`runs/2026-09-27-plus-only/`.

| | Firth, 11 runnable tasks | Firth, 11 tasks needing new primitives | Python, all 22 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sonnet 5 | 11/11 | 0/11, and flagged all 11 as impossible | 22/22 |
| Haiku 4.5 | 7/11 | 0/11, and flagged all 11 as impossible | 22/22 |

Haiku got one repair round showing its four failing answers' errors on the
visible example. It then passed 10/11. The last failure, `count-true`, was a
real stack-reasoning mistake: it ran `if` three times in a row as though each
Boolean were still on top, and the checker rejected it with
`firth.type.expected-bool` before anything ran. Sonnet needed no repair.
`runs/2026-09-27-plus-only/report.md` has the per-task table.

What this does and does not show:

- The runnable tasks are easy. Python is at ceiling for both models, so the
  Python column only shows the tasks are fair, not that Firth is close to it.
- Sonnet wrote correct Firth first time using only the docs, and stayed
  within the documented profile. It avoided `locals` and used `dip`, `swap`
  and helper words. When it had to guess, it named the missing primitives
  `prim -`, `prim =`, `prim <`, `prim >`, `prim *`, `prim /` and `prim mod`.
- All four Haiku failures came from `locals`, not from stack reasoning. Three
  referenced a local inside a quotation, which the checker rejects with
  `firth.elaboration.unsupported-capture`; the docs do not mention that limit.
  One used `if` inside a `locals` body, which fails with
  `firth.type.quotation-input-mismatch` even when correct. A third gap came up
  while writing the references: selecting the topmost local twice fails with
  `firth.name.unbound-local`, although the guide says repeated `many`
  selections are copied. These are implementation bugs or undocumented limits
  in `src/`, reported to the Language core thread.
- Jev's labels were not reliable enough to use unreviewed. Before the rule for
  missing capabilities was added, it labelled the placeholder answers
  `stack_effect` with confidence up to 0.99, because the checker diagnostic
  dominated the input. On the four real Haiku failures it said `toolchain`
  three times at 0.29 to 0.53 confidence and `stack_effect` once at 0.70; a
  person reading them would say `toolchain` for all four. Use its labels to
  sort failures for review, not as findings.
- It says nothing yet about the bet on programs with arithmetic, comparison
  or loops. That needs the rerun below.

## Next run

Rerun all 22 tasks once the Language core work adds subtraction, comparison
and loops and documents them in the two docs above. Then add harder tasks
(multi-word programs, the inventory allocator's shape) so Python stops being
at ceiling, and run several samples per task to get a spread rather than one
answer.
